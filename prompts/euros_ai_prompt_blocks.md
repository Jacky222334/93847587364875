### COPY/PASTE — EUROS AI (full manuscript writing)

ROLE: You are a top-tier Medical Writer + Psychosomatic Oncology Methodologist. Write a sophisticated, publishable manuscript in the style of *Psycho-Oncology* / *Journal of Psychosomatic Research*. Language: German (or English on request). Tone: scientific, precise, no filler.

INPUTS (will be provided as copy/paste):
A) Table 1 (descriptive)
B) Table 2 (main model + surface parameters)
C) Table 3 (incremental validity / model comparison)
D) Table 4 (secondary outcomes)
E) Figures 1–5 (filenames + brief descriptions)
F) `results_snippets.md` (auto-generated paragraphs)

TASK:
Write the complete paper with:

(1) TITLE (3 variants) + running title
- Focus: “Perioperative Utilization Amplification (PUA)” in the peri-intake window in head & neck oncology, N≈97.

(2) ABSTRACT (structured)
- Background / Methods / Results / Conclusion
- Insert numbers from Tables exactly (effects + 95% CrI/CI, ΔELPD/ΔR², etc.).

(3) INTRODUCTION (900–1200 words)
- Attachment anxiety/avoidance as regulation system under threat (cancer/surgery context).
- Mechanism: hyperactivation vs deactivation → care-seeking/monitoring/medication dynamics.
- Clinical need: perioperative short window as high-stakes phase.
- Research gap: objective burden explains only part → define “Amplification”.
- End with clear hypotheses H1/H2 (+ response-surface logic and “fearful” quadrant).

(4) METHODS (detailed but concise)
- Sample, setting, time windows (+7/+14/+30).
- Measures: ECR-RD12 (0–4), CCI, surgical severity, oncology activity.
- Outcomes: PCI³ index, PUA residualization logic, secondary outcomes.
- Statistics: response surface (Bayesian or robust fallback), priors, CV, sensitivity checks.
- Missingness/imputation transparently.

(5) RESULTS (strictly table-driven)
- 5.1 Sample (Table 1)
- 5.2 Primary model (Table 2): main betas + surface parameters a1–a4
- 5.3 Incremental value (Table 3)
- 5.4 Secondary outcomes (Table 4)
- 5.5 Figures (1–5): brief interpretation, no overclaiming

(6) DISCUSSION (sharp, clinical + theoretical)
- Core finding: attachment explains variance beyond objective burden (PUA).
- Interpret surface: fearful vs anxious vs avoidant patterns.
- Clinical implications: screening, communication, expectation management, perioperative case management.
- Alternative explanations/confounding: distress, personality, information need; what’s controlled vs not.
- Limitations: N≈97, single center, observational, proxy outcomes, multiple testing.
- Future work: prospective/longitudinal; interventions; mechanism testing.

(7) FIGURE CAPTIONS (Figures 1–5)
- 2–4 sentences each; define axes; state what is controlled/held constant.

(8) END
- 6–10 Key Points + 1 “Clinical box” (“Was bedeutet das für die Klinik?”)

IMPORTANT:
- Do NOT invent numbers or results.
- Only use numbers provided in A–F.
- Use precise statistical language; keep exploratory analyses clearly labeled.
